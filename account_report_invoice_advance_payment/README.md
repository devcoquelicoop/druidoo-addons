Account Report Invoice Advance Payment
======================================

Moves the advance payment lines in the invoice report to the subtotal table, and makes adjustments to the calculated subtotals to show the 'pending balance'.
This is not the actual pending balance, as it doesn't actually checkes the moves. It just computes the amount based on the advance payment line.
